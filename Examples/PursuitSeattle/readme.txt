	"Nothing is too hard, for him"
	
	"The Lord is not intimidated by the Northwest, and neither are we"
	
	"If he can do it here, well he can do it ANYWHERE"
	
	"A journey which began, a few years ago back here in a later barn, in Snohomish"
	
	February 6th @ 6PM | March 6th @ 6PM |  April 3rd @ 6PM

	At Philadelphia Church, in Seattle, WA (7704 24th Ave NW, Seattle, WA 98117)

	Don't tell me that God can't reach the city, don't tell me that christianity can't impact the culture, don't tell me the bible is so outdated, we need to change it in order to reach millenials don't tell me we have to water things down in order to appeal to creatives Jesus is the same today, yesterday and forever and by his spirit he is still saving people from every sphere, of society 
	
	Join us for three, historic nights
	
	Evening services, monthly in Seattle seeing his glory impact, into your lives
	
	Ah pastor you think you can change a city just by gathering, a couple thousand of worshippers, on one random night - Yeah, absolutely yes; that's how God works. And in fact thats what has been missing, from our region for too many years
	
	Indebbted to the harvest field, meaning that I owe, the harvest field then with an encounter with Jesus! More than safe and comfortable services, and music no - we owe the region a moment of revival and re-awakening
	
	And a god that shows up in power, as we're bringing here rattles a region, that has been asleep for too long
	
	God is going to do some monumental things and we are just excited, to be a part of his story
	
	We're going to rally the region, and we're going to see God do some transformative works
	
	I am not a victim, of the region's narrative as the church, we are going to rewrite the story of God's faithfulness, for the northwest
	
	No I understand what the Ecclesates are we the elected of God who gather in our church which is the pillar of truth in society and when we gather we gather with spiritua, legislative authority to rewrite the rules
	
	
	Matthew 9:37-38
	
	The goal isn't a big crowd, it is an assembled, people
	
	Because when Christians get assembled, the church becomes unstoppable
	
	Its when you fall alone, and you don't got nobody else then to help you back up the danger is not in the mistake you made, the danger isn't even in the sin, that you struggle the danger isn't even in the fact that you're going to miss it, every then once in awhile the danger is if your spiritually homeless, and not assembled in the context of a growing church when you fall you don't got any resources, then to pick you back up
	
	And he is there to pick you up, dust you off and then prepare for a brighter tomorrow we were built for this
	
	
@section 	Awakening in Seattle
	Over the last 12 months, we have been experiencing an outpouring of God’s Spirit in the Pacific Northwest. People have traveled from all across the region, and nation, to witness what God is doing in the little town of Snohomish.
	
	We have seen thousands of people encounter the presence of God in life-changing ways. Salvations, spontaneous baptisms, physical healings, miracles, and deliverance have become the Sunday morning norm. There is a palpable hunger for the things of God like I have never seen before.
	
	Snohomish is a town of 10,000. We are seeing up to 25% of the city’s population show up for church. Something significant is happening in our midst. 
	
	As we have sought the Lord in prayer, it seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us that we should contend for awakening in Seattle. 
	
	If God can do it in Snohomish, He can do it in Seattle. I’m inviting you to be a part of Revival Nights in Seattle and join us in lifting high the name of Jesus and seeing His Kingdom expand all around us.
