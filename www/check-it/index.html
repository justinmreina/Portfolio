    <h1>Ok</h1>	I have heard you exclaim struggles, with life around you a few times recently and I wanted to share how I saw that - you are berating perhaps your most prized possessions check this out (maybe I dunno) - 		Your non-idealities blossom novelty which sets you apart, grows something leave and leaves you outstanding beyond all else without that, if you want it. Use my testimony for courage perhaps, after eight years of in-palattable, surreal defeat, humilation and recession I persisted, sitting now at a horizon into my dreams and life next in Madison		From my journaling: <a href="Memoirs Content - Introduction.pdf">Memoirs Content - Introduction.pdf</a>		Summary Recap of these past eight years		• Year 1: Six hours daily counseling & therapy, seven days a week. Taught me how to walk, talk & eat food again per se, how to blink & use my tongue before that. My brain got quite scrambled and your brain doesn't repair, it regrows - through practice ....		• Year 2: Bsck to work! Kind of, what a fucking humbling, and humiiating experience they cast me off to the test labs, with my co-workers staring agap in groups as I waled by at lunch. Fun		• Year 3: This mofo departed to pursue a smart-pumping tech startup in the middle east for an oil tycoon (don't believe me? A novel story) - here I departed ALL of my safety nets keeping me afloat, and alive departing for some horizon which fell short		• Year 4: Back home with my narcissistic parents a state away upstairs from my 30-year old special needs sister who lives downstairs. Un-employed, broke (spent all my money damn TBI...) and with a new counselor - "Oh don't worry Justin, things are so hard because your autistic? - What? 	• Year 5: Five departed churches & SEVEN departed churches later I came to realize - she was right		• Year 6: Into a new home and stabilizing, my limp departs		• Year 7ish: My speech slur departs and my eyes go straight		• Year 8: Sub-Zero of Madison calls and things begin to make sense		Let me know if interested, this is just a taste (e.g. Magic & the light-in-a-box, or quitting my dream job cause I knew better - TWICE)		Summary for you:		- You are a gem with a rare sparkle		- Every time you admonish, excuse or excape from the sparkle you defeat its cherished role for what it can be	- So hold that high and stand proud be firm - fuck normal people they live in a box; do you want to live in a box?		Love yourself, today is a gift beyond comprehension so cherish that; I do <wave>  </body>
