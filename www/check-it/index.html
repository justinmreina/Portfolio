    <h1>Ok</h1>	I have heard you exclaim struggles, with life around you a few times recently and I wanted to share how I saw that - where you disqualify or excuse perhaps your most prized possessions so check this out - 	<br><br>	So these non-idealities blossom a novelty which sets you apart, grows something new and leaves you outstanding beyond all the others, if you want it&#185;. Use my testimony for courage perhaps, after eight years of an un-palattable and surreal defeat, humilation and recession I persisted sitting now at a horizon unto my dreams and a new life in Madison today&#0178;	<br><br>	<ul>	<li><b>Impact - </b> 75 mph face-first into a stopped pickup & <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KRcDWquyWdAJSCxo9" target="_blank">life restarted</a>. Moderate grade, frontal lobe traumatic brain injury one of the worst. Was not supposed to survive, then open my eyes nor ever talk, not going to stand-up again or remember your name gosh though as he got better would never go back to work. Two million dollars, and two years later we proved them wrong - </li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 1 - </b> Six hours daily counseling & therapy, seven days a week. Taught me how to walk, talk & eat food again per se, how to blink & use my tongue before that. My brain got quite scrambled and your brain doesn't repair, it regrows - through practice ....</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 2 - </b> Back to work! Kind of what a fucking humbling, and humiliating experience they cast me off to the test labs, with my co-workers staring agap in groups as I walked by at lunch. Fun&#179;</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 3 - </b> This mofo departs to pursue a smart-pumping tech startup in the middle east for an oil tycoon (don't believe me? A novel story) - here I departed ALL of my safety nets keeping me afloat, and alive departing for some horizon which fell short</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 4 - </b> Back home with my narcissistic parents a state away, upstairs here from my 30-year old special needs sister who lived downstairs. Un-employed, broke (spent all my money damn TBI...) and with a new counselor - "Oh don't worry Justin, things are so hard because your autistic" - What? </li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 5 - </b> Five departed churches & SEVEN departed churches later I came to realize - she was right</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 6 - </b> Into a new home and stabilizing, my limp departs</li>	<br>		<li><b>Year 7 - </b> My speech slur departs and my eyes go straight. Finding a new breath&#8308; now, in <a href="https://youtu.be/mb-epsQcg8Q" target="_blank">Celebrate Recovery</a> (in Madison too you may like)</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 8 - </b> Sub-Zero of Madison calls and things begin to make sense, the lights to life turn on for me here&#8309;</li>	</ul>	<br>	&nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just a taste, more if interested (e.g. Magic & the light-in-a-box, or quitting my dream job cause I knew better - TWICE)	<br><br>	<h2>So for you, imho - </h2>	<ul>	<li>You are a gem with a rare sparkle, hold that bright	<br>	<li>And yet every time you admonish, excuse or escape from this sparkle you defeat its cherished role, for what lies around and what calls ahead</li>	<br>	<li>So hold this high, stand proud & be firm - fuck normal people they live in a box; do you want that for you? .... This is the best they can do and your existence challenges them, which is also beyond their comprehension imho; that is ok</li>	</ul>	<br>	Love yourself, today is a gift beyond comprehension cherish that (I do). My experiences, disposition and character there I cherish, with the weirdest & most painful parts being the glue that holds it together, I cherish this today with every breath and on every step - hope <wave>	<br><br>	<b>Notes:</b>	<ul>	<li>1.
