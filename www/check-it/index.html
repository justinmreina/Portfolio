    <h1>Ok</h1>	I have heard you exclaim struggles, with life around you a few times recently and I wanted to share how I saw that - I have seen you disqualify or excuse perhaps your most prized possessions, check this out maybe - 	<br><br>	So these non-idealities blossom a novelty which sets you apart, grows something new and leaves you outstanding beyond all the others, if you want it. Use my testimony for courage perhaps, after eight years of un-palattable and surreal defeat, humilation and recession I persisted sitting now at a horizon unto my dreams and a new life in Madison today	<br><br>	<h2>My Summary - </h2>	&nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From my journaling: <a href="Memoirs Content - Introduction.pdf" target="_blank">Memoirs Content - Introduction.pdf</a>	<br>		<ul>	<li><b>Impact - </b> 75 mph face-first into a stopped pickup & <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KRcDWquyWdAJSCxo9" target="_blank">life restarted</a>. Moderate grade, frontal lobe traumatic brain injury one of the worst. Was not supposed to survive, then open my eyes nor ever talk, not going to stand-up again or remember your name gosh though as he got better would never go back to work. Two million dollars, and two years later we proved them wrong - </li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 1 - </b> Six hours daily counseling & therapy, seven days a week. Taught me how to walk, talk & eat food again per se, how to blink & use my tongue before that. My brain got quite scrambled and your brain doesn't repair, it regrows - through practice ....</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 2 - </b> Bsck to work! Kind of, what a fucking humbling, and humiiating experience they cast me off to the test labs, with my co-workers staring agap in groups as I walked by at lunch. Fun</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 3 - </b> This mofo departs to pursue a smart-pumping tech startup in the middle east for an oil tycoon (don't believe me? A novel story) - here I departed ALL of my safety nets keeping me afloat, and alive departing for some horizon which fell short</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 4 - </b> Back home with my narcissistic parents a state away, upstairs here from my 30-year old special needs sister who lived downstairs. Un-employed, broke (spent all my money damn TBI...) and with a new counselor - "Oh don't worry Justin, things are so hard because your autistic" - What? </li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 5 - </b> Five departed churches & SEVEN departed churches later I came to realize - she was right</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 6 - </b> Into a new home and stabilizing, my limp departs</li>	<br>		<li><b>Year 7 - </b> My speech slur departs and my eyes go straight. Found my new breath now, in <a href="https://youtu.be/mb-epsQcg8Q" target="_blank">Celebrate Recovery</a> (in Madison too you may like)</li>	<br>	<li><b>Year 8 - </b> Sub-Zero of Madison calls and things begin to make sense, the lights to life turn on</li>	</ul>	<br>	&nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just a taste, more if interested (e.g. Magic & the light-in-a-box, or quitting my dream job cause I knew better - TWICE)	<br><br>	<h2>So for you, imho - </h2>	<ul>	<li>You are a gem with a rare sparkle</li>	<br><br>	<li>And every time you admonish, excuse or escape from this sparkle you defeat its cherished role for what is around you</li>	<br><br>	<li>So hold that high and stand proud be firm - fuck normal people they live in a box; do you want that too? This is the best they can do and your existence challenges them, and is beyond their comprehension imho; that is ok</li>	</ul>	<br><br>	Love yourself, today is a gift beyond comprehension cherish that (I do). My experiences, disposition and character there I cherish, with the weirdest & most painful parts being the glue that holds it together, I cherish this today with every breath and on every step - hope <wave>	<br><br>	<br><br>	<br><br>	<br><br>	<br><br>	<br><br>	  </body>
