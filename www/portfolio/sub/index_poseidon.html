    <h1>Human Powered Submarine - Round One</h1>		Our entry to this idea was seeded by Adam Huxtable, and with a few colleagues and we began. Poseidon was a titan, 13' long and cylindrical in diameter there was plenty of room inside and fit well, which was important imagine transporting this behometh thousands of miles to a navy research base and hopping inside. Basic controls, scuba and mechanical were enough, and we transported Poseidon to Bethesda, MD for competition where she performed successfully (steadfast and slow!)				<br>		<br>				Also note the masking tape and plastic, in the bottom left to the windshiled - controls was an emperically established craft for me then! Not like next year, to note when Erik hooked them up backwards this time it was just, SLOW in speed, response, actuation & effect. Took us some practice!				<br>		<br>	<center>		<table>		<tr>			<th><img src="pit area.jpg" width="400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</img></th>			<th><img src="omer5-record holder.jpg" width="400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</img></th>			<th><img src="repair time.jpg" width="400"></img></th>		</tr>		<tr>			<th><img src="race conditioned.jpg" width="400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</img></th>			<th><img src="loading drivers.jpg" width="400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</img></th>			<th></th>		</tr>			</table> 	</center>	<br>	<br>
