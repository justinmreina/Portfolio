So a few years back I suffered a heavyweight, frontal-lobe TBI and life stopped. Turns out motorcycles are dangerous, but 50 miles out in the country I got this. Or not, face-first into a pickup at 70 mph, t-boning the sister of a retired EMT and life disappeared. This horror continued though, fifteen feet in the air next collapsing face down in a puddle don't touch him, we'll be there as fast as we can that's law

To Gary's retort, "Boys he will drown before then I will see you shortly", running out his front door and pulling me up, breaking the law to save my life. And first, albehaveit over his sister he grabbed me he knew I had moments, and a magical tale began. Shouldn't have happened, but it did

It stopped, and then restarted so magically a journey began. At least they tell me because here the lights turned off, relearning humanity life became brand new, in ways I did not deserve - and was TERRIFYING. Well kind of; I was the neurological equivalent of a toddler for several weeks

What gift he unleashed, such lessons! In your late 20's off a big product & school, look how important I am being retaught then how to use your tongue & blink, what a hug was and why you can't buy everything things became real. And here, the Lord's patience & craft shone with brilliance the investments & sacrifice to give Justin but a chance, still shatter me what earthly forms can erect such solution!!? Check this out - 

- Ma living with me at the hospital for a few months

- Dad remodeling his house with a hospital bed downstairs, open-ended in duration

- My girlfriend's endurance & sacrifice imagine dating a lonely toddler per se, who proposed to you on every visit using the wrong name

- Gary the EMT who saved me, choosing to pull me up first despite his sister who was face down on the steering wheel in a moment where the 911 operator said "Don't touch him"

- My employer Intel, who paid $2M of bills (and gave me that bike, btw in a raffle), waiting a full year to give me a chance back in our advanced Intel Wireless Labs

- .... oh my

 It was here then where Grace became more than a description it was an experience. I began to see his presence, in craftful articulation at every move, at all of the time I never deserved it, but he was always there. Boy that took him effort! 
 
 And this arose to a rhytem, to note where I releared how to hold a beat with my hands, sing a note with my chorus and how to sing and clap at the same time. Some interesting PT sessions, weekly for two years (it took FIVE years for me to be resume singing over a clap at church, to note). I love music and in this, my recovery's essence began. For me this came through the vehicles of D.Mulligan, Lecrae's team, my ministries group and yourself - 

Your connection to your message, attention to its reception and truth to its craft now I BELIEVE that, understanding not just what amen means but how to receive that. No longer just said but experienced, and quite often today some interesting stories
