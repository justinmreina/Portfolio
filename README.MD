## Detail
This porfolio space serves to (a) clean up my sloppy webpage, (b) present my working value & (c) express my passion for the work I do. A sandbox & select utilities are also presented for group work as needed.

This is also a focal point for my leisure time I do this for fun, lets have this achieve a focused result!
